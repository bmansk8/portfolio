      <h3>GRIFFIN Global Technologies, LLC - (current position)</h3>
      <h4>Title: Software developer II</h4>
      <p>
        I have experience in creating digital human experiences using software
        and technology. This includes full-fledged applications, websites,
        microservices, online events, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped create a monorepo/platform that uses multiple databases (SQL,
        Mongo, Postgress), multiple authentication services (custom auth,
        google, facebook, and microsoft), a custom front-end framework, a custom
        CLI tool, and a custom sitecopy/configuration management/css generation
        tool that added support for multiple languages to websites. All of these
        were built in-house and then used for production level applications. I
        also created and supported multiple demos involving business use cases
        with AI that where built on these custom in house tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I maintained over 10 legacy and modern applications using C#, .NET 4.8
        through .NET 6, SQL, and Vue as well as multiple SQL and .NET/Entity
        Framework database projects. I supported multiple successful production
        deployments. Did several .NET project migrations. Did several database
        migrations with custom SQL migration scripts. As well as maintaining and
        improving a legacy central hub application that used .NET MVC pattern
        with Vue and a SQL database

      <p>
        I ported over two custom packages for APIs and database management from
        Node and Express to Python with Flask. I also ported over integrations
        with authentication, AWS, Langchain, email systems, MongoDB, and
        middleware. These packages, once ported to Python, were then used in
        Python APIs that integrated with the existing Node APIs and helped us
        create applications that utilized AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also helped create custom digital online events. These were completely
        built and designed to match high-fidelity Figma and Adobe XD design
        mockups. They utilized a custom code injection framework that works on
        top of other frameworks.
