        Creating digital human experiences via software and technology. These
        might be full blown applications, websites, micro services, online
        events, vr/ar applications, or truly anything. This included creating a
        mono repo/platform that used multiple db's, multiple authentication
        services, a custom front end framework, and a custom configuration tool.
        All built custom and in house. As well as custom digital online events.
        Completely built and designed to match high fidelity figma and adobe XD
        design mockups. These utilized custom code injection frameworks that
        work on top of other frameworks.
