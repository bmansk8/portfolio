        I have experience in creating digital human experiences using software
        and technology. This includes full-fledged applications, websites,
        microservices, online events, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped create a monorepo/platform that uses multiple databases,
        multiple authentication services, a custom front-end framework, and a
        custom configuration tool. All of these were built in-house.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ported over two custom packages for APIs and database management from
        Node and Express to Python with Flask. I also ported over integrations
        with authentication, AWS, Langchain, email systems, MongoDB, and
        middleware. These packages, once ported to Python, were then used in
        Python APIs that integrated with the existing Node APIs and helped us
        create applications that utilized AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also helped create custom digital online events. These were completely
        built and designed to match high-fidelity Figma and Adobe XD design
        mockups. They utilized a custom code injection framework that works on
        top of other frameworks.

        Creating custom software and web solutions for the online event space as
        well as custom integration software. This included a custom web based js
        injection framework, and back-end hosting of that solution. Along with
        creating micro services, database work, and integration software with C#
        for things like Jira and Salesforce.

        Creating custom software and web solutions for the online event space as
        a junior developer. This included using pre existing web event
        platforms, and creating a custom framework to inject JS, HTML and CSS on
        top of that pre-existing framework
