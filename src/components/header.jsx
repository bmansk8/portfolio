      <p>
        I'm a mid level full stack web developer. I'm most comfortable in React.
        Recently I have been working in the event space using React, Typescript,
        and custom injection frameworks built in house. I'm laid back and easily
        self motivated. Iâ€™m a musician and that is my main creative outlet. Also
        writing, journaling, and 3d printing are some of my main hobbies.
