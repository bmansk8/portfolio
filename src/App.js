        <h1>Barron M V Brock</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a mid level full stack web developer. I'm most comfortable in
          React and the AWS cloud. I recently have gotten into using babylon.js,
          three.js, and mozilla hubs to create ar/vr experinces. I'm laid back
          and easily self motivated. Iâ€™m a musician and that is my main creative
          outlet. Also writing, journaling, and 3d printing are some of my main
          hobbies.

          Creating digital human experiences via software and technology. These
          might be full blown applications, websites, micro services, online
          events, vr/ar applications, or truly anything. This includes using
          TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, tailwindcss, C#, Azure, and plenty
          of other frameworks/tools.
        </p>

        <h3>Griffin solutions - (1yr 4mos)</h3>
        <p>
          I created software! Whether it was web based with html, css, js, react
          and more. Or .NET or node.js solutions. This included creating a
          proprietary front end framework to inject code into pre-existing
          online event technologies. Also creating dedicated
          integration/application software develoment as well as maintence for
          legacy applications in c# and javascript/node.
